### Overview

This is the capstone project for module 2 at FlatIron School's Online DS Program. I was given a modified dataset of House Sales in King County and was tasked to use what I've learned to create a model to predict house prices.

This notebook consist of data cleaning, EDA, and basic multilinear regression models aimed to predict King County house prices. My approach and ideology was that of a consumer who was looking to buy a home in King county and used basic domain knowledge to explain my speculations and findings.This was just a beginner project and does not represent the actual housing market in King County.

### Questions

I. What do consumer look for?
>3 catergories come to mind when housing hunting; LOCATION of home, FEATURES such as # of be/bathrooms,size, etc., and Quality of home.
    
II. Are there external factors that could affect our data?
>After creating a price comparison by floors I notice a decrease of price from two floor homes to three floor home. Which lead me to discover that King County is right on top of the Seattle Fault. Plus the fact that it near bodies of water makes them prone to earthquakes and tsunami


### Future Improvements

Gathering more data, the dataset only consisted of sales between 2014-2015, more data could help the model be more accurate. Features such as zipcode,lat, and log could have been incorporated in more unique ways such that locations impact on price could be explored further.
